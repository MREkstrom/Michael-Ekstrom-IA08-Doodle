# Michael-Ekstrom-IA08-Doodle

This repository holds all of the code neccessary to run my doodle project. To run it, go to Android studio and create a new project from version control, designating this repository as the target. To run the code, Marshmallow 64_x86 was used in conjuction with a Galaxy Nexus emulator.

The app works as a standard doodle app. The color selection is constrained to a Hue slider, so one can only use fully saturated colors. This gives a slightly juvenille color palette, but this fealt appropriate for a doodle app.

The special features are the undo/redo buttons, as well as the rotate option to their right. This allows you to rotate your current drawings around before drawing more stuff on top of it.
